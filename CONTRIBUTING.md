# Contributing

We love your work. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute to our project. This document describes the steps you need to take to contribute to our project.

## Steps

- Feature branches should be created from the 'saas' branch, based on the target deployment.
- Use the convention `[feat/update/fix/]SVA-...`, aligning with the corresponding Jira ticket, if existing.
- include `SVA-[Ticket-Number]` at the bottom of the commits message description, if existing.
- Pull Requests (PRs):
  - Description: Provide a detailed description, preferably with supporting images
    - when creating a merge request, the system automatically adds a comment such as “closes [ticket number]”. To maintain clarity and avoid redundancy, ensure this auto-generated comment is removed.
  - Assignees: Assign yourself as the PR owner
  - Reviewers: Add two colleagues for peer review
  - Labels: Attach the appropriate label to categorize the PR
- Jira, if you have access
  - Assign the category (e.g., 'Internal Review') within Jira
  - Select a person for review
  - Set a due date
  - Add a comment for additional context

## Commits

Please pay attention to detailed and meaningful commit messages.
